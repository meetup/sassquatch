title: Media Query Breakpoints
name: breakpoints
category: Sass Utilities

You can use the `atMedia` mixin to write styles
specific to a given viewport size.

Building elastic layouts is encouraged, as most
Sassquatch components are designed to fit 100%
width of their parent container.

Use breakpoints only when stretching and squeezing
a component starts to look broken.

```scss
	@include atMedia(small) {
		body::after {
			content: "only small screens can read me";
		}
	}
```

Breakpoint name    | Description
-------------------| ---------------------------------------------
`small`            | Small screens and under; portrait on most mobile devices
`medium`           | Landscape on most phones and under; portrait on some phablets
`large`            | Landscape on phabelts and under; portrait on most tablets or old desktops
`huge`             | Modern desktop viewports and under or [ridiculous huge tablets](http://liliputing.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/fox-big-tablets.jpg)
